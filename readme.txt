ned to fix precedence 

Replaced the old loop-based expression parser with a hierarchical recursive descent implementation to properly respect operator precedence.

Changes include:
- `expression()` now calls `parse_expr()` to begin parsing.
- Introduced precedence layers:
  - `parse_expr()` â†’ entry point
  - `parse_cmp()` handles ==, <, >
  - `parse_add_sub()` handles +, -
  - `parse_mul_div()` handles *, /, %
  - `parse_primary()` handles literals, variables, grouped expressions, and function calls.
- This resolves the previously failing test: `return 2 + 3 * 4;` which incorrectly returned 20 instead of 14.
- Ensured parenthesis grouping takes highest precedence.

All existing unit tests pass after this fix.
